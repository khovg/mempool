## 0.4.0 - 2021-07-01

### Added
- Capability to enable and disable the traces with a CSR
- CPU model for MemPool in GCC to enable correct instruction scheduling
- Added GitHub CI flow

### Changed
- Allow atomic extension to be enabled in GCC

- Move flat hardware dependencies to submodules
- Updated LLVM to version 12
- Updated Halide to version 12
- Run unit tests with Verilator
- Rename `mempool` `mempool_cluster`
- Restructure software folder

### Fixed
- Stall cycle counting in the trace no longer misses stalls
- Remove unwanted latches in instruction cache
- Boot ROM address offset depends on the data width of the ROM

## 0.3.0 - 2021-03-31

### Added
- Toolchain and hardware support for Xpulp instructions:
  - Post-incrementing and register-register loads and stores (`pv.lb[u]`, `pv.lh[u]`, `pv.lw`)
  - 32-bit multiply-accumulate instructions (`pv.mac`, `pv.msu`)
  - Arithmetic SIMD instructions (`pv.{add, sub, abs, avg, avgu, min, minu, max, maxu, srl, sra, sll, or, xor, and, dotsp, dotup, dotusp, sdotsp, sdotup, sdotusp}.{h, b}`
  - Sub-word manipulation SIMD instructions (`pv.{extract, extractu, insert, shuffle2}.{h, b}`)

### Fixed
- Disable the branch prediction if there are multiple early-hits
- Align end of `.text` section with the instruction cache
- Observe the code style guidelines in the matrix multiplication and convolution kernels

### Changed
- Clean-up the pedantic compilation warnings of the matrix multiplication and convolution kernels

## 0.2.0 - 2021-03-29

### Added
- Assertion checking that Snitch's instruction interface is stable during stalls

### Changed
- Update `axi` dependency to 0.27.1
- Change I$ policy to avoid evicting the cache-line currently in use
- Make the L0 cache's data latch-based and double its size
- Make the L1 cache's tag latch-based
- Serialize the L1 lookup

### Fixed
- Add a workaround for a Modelsim 2019 bug in the `axi_demux`
- Keep clang-format from reformatting the `apps/common/riscv_test.h` assembly header file

## 0.1.0 - 2021-03-17
- Initial release.
